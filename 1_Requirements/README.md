# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM

This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen. Because driving a vehicle in the rain is quite difficult, we will use wipers to clear the front screen of the vehicle, which is a mirror, so that we may drive the vehicle even in the rain.


### WORKING PROCESS
* When the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be on ACC mode.

* When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.

* When the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.

* When the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.

# SWOT Analysis 
## Strength
* Visibility
* The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window during drive.
* Safety

## Weakness 
* High cost
* Not automatic

## Threats 
* Once the board repaired cannot be replaced quickly
